Schedule social media content to be automatically posted at a later date!

#### Overview

RoamJS already supports various extensions to post to sites like Twitter directly from Roam. But each of these posts are immediate. It's often useful to create a bunch of content in one sitting, and schedule them to be sent at a later date! This allows the inconsistent cadence of your creativity to align with a desired consistent cadence of publishing.

This RoamJS Service works with other RoamJS extensions to allow you to schedule when content should be published. You can draft, schedule, and view pending requests all from within Roam!

#### Setup

Make sure you have a RoamJS account by [signing up here](/signup).

On your [user page](/user), you should see a "Social" Tab. By clicking `generate token`, you will be subscribed to the RoamJS service. After subscribing, you will be shown a token which you should copy. **DO NOT SHARE THIS TOKEN WITH ANYONE**. If you do or lose it by mistake, you could generate a new one. Copy this token.

In your Roam database, create a `[[roam/js/social]]` page and a block that says `Token`. As a child of that block, paste in your RoamJS token:

#### Usage

Now that we're all set up, using RoamJS Social will vary based on the extension we are using.

##### Twitter

First, be sure to install the [twitter](/docs/extensions/twitter) extension to your Roam Graph and set it up to **send tweets.** Now when you draft a Tweet and click the Twitter icon, you should see a new button that says `Schedule Tweet`.

Clicking the button will bring you to a datepicker where you could decide when the tweet should be published.

Hitting "Schedule" will queue the tweet to be executed. When you log into your Twitter account after specified time, you should see the Roam block on your Twitter feed!
