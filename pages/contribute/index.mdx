# CONTRIBUTE

There are several ways to contribute to RoamJS!

## Pull Request

The entire project is open source, which you could find [here](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roam-js-extensions)! Check out the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for details on how to contribute. In general, I am accepting pull requests for fixing individual issues and building new extensions!

## Hosted

If instead you'd like to build your own extensions in your own repository to be hosted on RoamJS, reach out to me for details! I'm most responsive on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dvargas92495) and at my email, dvargas92495@gmail.com.

## Sponsor

You could also contribute by sponsoring the project! Making this a financially sustainable venture will continue to allow me to do this full time.

The best way to sponsor the project is through the GitHub button below:

<GithubSponsor />

If you don't have a GitHub account, the next best way is through the GiveButter campaign below:

<GiveButter />
