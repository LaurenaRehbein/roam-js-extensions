# RoamJS

###### Use Roam Like A Power User

RoamJS is an online library of [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) Extensions and Services. Features range from integrations with third party services to new Roam components. 

All Extensions are **free** to install and use. You could find more information on how to use each one in our [docs](/docs). 

We **do not** recommend installing _all_ the extensions RoamJS has to offer. This would be like installing all the apps from Apple's store onto your device. Each extension has a negligible effect on performance, but compounded could make your Roam database run noticeably slower.

Instead, focus on installing only the extensions that give you the highest utility.

Services are a collection of Roam-related automations that help you better tap into the power of your Roam graph. Unlike extensions which run directly on **your graph**, Services run on resources **managed by RoamJS**. You could subscribe to each service individually to gain access to its functionality. To take advantage of RoamJS Services, make sure to sign up for an account [here](/signup). If you are more technically minded and do not want to pay for a RoamJS Service, there will be tutorials for each service on how to use them on your self-hosted resources.
