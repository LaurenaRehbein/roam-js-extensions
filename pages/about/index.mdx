# RoamJS

###### Use Roam Like A Power User

RoamJS is an online library of [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) Extensions and Services. Features range from integrations with third party services to new Roam components. 

All Extensions are **free** to install and use. You could find more information on how to use each one in our [docs](/docs). 

We **do not** recommend installing _all_ the extensions RoamJS has to offer. This would be like installing all the apps from Apple's store onto your device. Each extension has a negligible effect on performance, but compounded could make your Roam database run noticeably slower.

Instead, focus on the extensions that give you the highest utility.
