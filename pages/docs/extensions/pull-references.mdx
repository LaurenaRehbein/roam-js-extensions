description: 'The Pull References gives user the ability to pull references to the page.'

The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/pull-references]]` page:

- `Format` - (Optional) The format that each reference will use when added to the page. Use `${ref}` to specify where you want the text to be replaced by the block reference.
- `Remove Tags` - (Optional) Set to 'True' if you would like to remove the tags from the block references after pulling them to the page.

Here's an example configuration from my personal DB:

![](/images/pull-references.png)

Create a button by typing `{{pull references}}` into a page. Clicking the button adds all the linked references as references on the current page.

This extension is also integrated with [Smart Blocks](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roamhacker/page/GH0401tnt)! If you have both this extension and Roam42 installed, there will be a `<%PULLREFERENCES%>` command available. The command will automatically pull the linked references and paste blocks before continuing with the rest of the workflow.

### Moving TODOs

To enable this feature, add the phrase `Move Todos` to a block on the `roam/js/pull-references` page and refresh Roam. On any block with a TODO on a daily notes page, a rightward facing arrow icon will appear on hover. Clicking the icon will allow you to pick a date to "move" the TODO to. After moving, the new block will block alias the original block and the original block will block alias the new block.
