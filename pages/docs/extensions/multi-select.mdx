Roam natively supports bulk operations when blocks are consecutive. This extension gives you the ability to perform those same bulk operations on non consecutive blocks!

To use the multi select, hold on CTRL on Windows or CMD on Mac before clicking a block. Once multiple blocks are selected, you could do the following operations:

- Move blocks - Pick any of the selected block bullets and drag it to the new location.
- Copy blocks - Hitting CTRL+C (Windows) or CMD+C (Mac) will copy the contents of the non consecutively selected blocks.
- Cut blocks - Hitting CTRL+X (Windows) or CMD+X (Mac) will cut the contents of the non consecutively selected blocks.
- Copy block refs - Hitting CTRL+Shift+C (Windows) or CMD+Shift+X (Mac) will copy the references of the non consecutively selected blocks.
