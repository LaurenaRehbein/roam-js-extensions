import Loom from '../../../components/Loom'

Simply drag an `.mp4` file into Roam. Natively, Roam tries to render this as an image and it appears blank. With this extension installed, the video is rendered correctly!

#### Youtube Timestamps

Roam natively supports embedding youtube videos with the `{{[[video]]: link}}` block. When you embed a youtube link with the video extension installed, a small marker will appear on the top right corner. Clicking this marker will add and save timestamps. You could use these timestamps to pin start and end points for looping. You could also use these timestamps to jump to certain points in the video.
