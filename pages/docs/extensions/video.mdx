import Loom from '../../../components/Loom'

Simply drag an `.mp4` file into Roam. Natively, Roam tries to render this as an image and it appears blank. With this extension installed, the video is rendered correctly!

#### Looping With Youtube

Roam natively supports embedding youtube videos with the `{{[[video]]: link}}` block. When you embed a youtube link with the video extension installed, a small marker will appear on the top right corner. Clicking this marker will set start and end points that the video will use to loop through.
