import Loom from '../../../components/Loom'

Simply drag an `.mp4` file into Roam. Natively, Roam tries to render this as an image and it appears blank. With this extension installed, the video is rendered correctly!

#### Youtube Timestamps

Roam natively supports embedding youtube videos with the `{{[[video]]: link}}` block. When you embed a youtube link with the video extension installed, two icons will appear on the top right corner. 

- The first is a marker icon. Clicking this marker will add and save timestamps. You could also use these timestamps to jump to certain points in the video. The second icon allows you to copy a link to the video that will play at that timestamp.
- The secons is a loop icon. Clicking this icon a first time will add a timestamp just like above. Clicking it a second time will add a second timestamp in the same block that could be used for looping. Pressing play on that block will play the video in a loop.

Feel free to record notes and add labels **after** the number for each timestamp or as child blocks.
