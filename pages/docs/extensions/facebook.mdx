You will have to first head to the `roam/js/facebook` page to login with your account.

### Posting

On any given block, create a `{{fb}}` button. A Facebook icon will be rendered in its place. Click the icon to see all the groups that you post your message to. Choose one and click send to publish the contents of the child block as a Facebook Group Post!
