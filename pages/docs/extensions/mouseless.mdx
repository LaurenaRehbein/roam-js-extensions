The script is not configurable.

The biggest hurdle to transitioning to a mouseless experience in any application is remembering what keyboard shortcut maps to what. This extension adds a "master" keyboard short cut in **CTRL+?** on both Windows and Mac. Once triggered, a help modal will appear where you could start typing your desired action to discover or remind yourself of what the key mapping is. Hit **ESC** to exit the modal back to the previously focused location.

The extension also adds the following shortcuts that were previously unsupported:
- `Ctrl-Shift-S` - Add Shortcut To Page
- `Ctrl-Shift-C` - Copy Current Block Ref
- `Alt-Ctrl-Shift-V` - Paste Block with children as references
- `Alt-v` - Toggle Parent Block View Type
- `Alt-Ctrl-Shift-A` - Replace last reference before cursor with text and alias
- `Alt-Ctrl-Shift-C` - Apply children as text
- `Alt-Ctrl-Shift-O` - Replace with original + bring nested items along
- `Alt-Ctrl-Shift-M` - Create Comment (coming soon)

The dialog also allows triggering these actions directly by navigating with the arrow keys and hitting enter.

More shortcuts will be added over time. Feel free to message RoamJS with suggestions!
