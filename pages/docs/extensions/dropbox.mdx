First, navigate to the `roam/js/dropbox` page to log into Roam with your Dropbox account. Once you grant RoamJS access to upload files for you, your credentials will be stored on this page.

Anytime you upload a file to Roam, the dropbox extension will intercept the upload and send it to your dropbox account instead.
