This extension adds a few features for introducing more context to various situations in Roam.

### Parent

If you add a `#parent` tag to a block, then wherever that block is rendered, the tag will be replaced by the contents of the parent block!

### Page

If you add a `#page` tag to a block, then wherever that block is rendered, the tag will be replaced by the page title that uses the block!
