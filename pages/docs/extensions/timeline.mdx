Enter `{{timeline}}` in any block to render the timeline view. By default, no events will be added.

Click the settings wrench to toggle on and off the Timeline configuration. Enter the tag that you would like to visualize across daily note pages. Click the refresh button once you're done configuring the timeline to get a refreshed view.

The timeline configuration will create blocks as children to the timeline component. You could edit the configuration by also editing these child blocks directly, hitting refresh once you're done.
