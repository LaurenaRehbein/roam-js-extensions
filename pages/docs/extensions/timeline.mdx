Enter `{{timeline}}` in any block to render the timeline view. By default, no events will be added.

Click the settings wrench to toggle on and off the Timeline configuration. Enter the tag that you would like to visualize across daily note pages. Blocks that reference both the tag and a daily note page will also be included. Click the refresh button once you're done configuring the timeline to get a refreshed view.

The timeline configuration will create blocks as children to the timeline component. You could edit the configuration by also editing these child blocks directly, hitting refresh once you're done.

#### Customization

By default, all the elements render using the `#2196f3` color. To define your own list of colors for the timeline to cycle through, add a child block called `colors` with each color on its own block.

The blocks themselves could also be customized through using `roam/css`. 
- `.vertical-timeline-element` is the container for each entry
- `.vertical-timeline-element-content` is the container for each card
- `.vertical-timeline-element-title` is the title within the content
- `.vertical-timeline-element-subtitle` is the subtitle within the content
- `.vertical-timeline-element-body` is the rest of the content body

#### Layout
By default, the timeline runs down the middle and elements alternate alignment left and right. To change the layout of the timeline, add a child block called `layout`. As a child of that block, you can set one of three values:
- `alt` - (default) Elements alternate left and right of the timeline
- `left` - The Timeline is aligned to the left, with the elements on the right
- `right` - The Timeline is aligned to the right, with the elements on the left

#### Reverse

By default, all the elements in the timeline render from latest to earliest. To reverse this setting so that the order is from earliest to latest, add a child block to the timeline with the text `reverse`. This setting could also be toggled on and off from the timeline configuration.

#### Creation Date

By default, all the blocks queried use the associated daily note page for ordering. To use the blocks' creation date instead for ordering, add a child block to the timeline with the text `Creation Date`. This setting could also be toggled on and off from the timeline configuration.

#### Clean

By default, all the blocks queried keep the query tag in its block text. To filter out both the tag and the daily note tag from the block text, add a child block to the timeline with the text `Clean`. This setting could also be toggled on and off from the timeline configuration.
