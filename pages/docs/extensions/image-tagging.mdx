description: 'The Image Tagging extension extracts the text from an image and outputs it into Roam!'
---

Hover over an image in your database. On hover, a magnifying glass icon with a T will appear near the Roam native block edit icon. Clicking the extension will use an OCR library to extract all the text found in an image. In the meantime, it will insert a "Loading..." text as a child block. Once the extension finishes, it will replace the Loading text with all the new text it parsed from the image.

If the text begins with a bullet or dash on a line, the bullet will be stripped, leaving the rest of the text content.

#### Triggers

By default, the trigger the extension uses to perform the text extraction is ICON CLICK. To change this to a different trigger create a page called `[[roam/js/image-tagging]]`. On it, create a block with the `Trigger::` attribute and map it to one of these three supported values:

- `DOUBLE CLICK`
- `SHIFT CLICK`
- `ICON CLICK`
