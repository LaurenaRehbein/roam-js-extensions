This extension integrates with [iframely](https://iframely.com), a uniform back-end and front-end service for all your app's rich media and URL data. You could generate embed friendly cards [here](https://iframely.com/embed).

To use this extension, type `{{iframely:[url]}}` into a block. Replace `[url]` with the actual url that you are looking to embed into Roam. The iframely extension will generate the embed friendly card and place within Roam!

There are multiple different view types for iframely embeds. You could configure a default one for all the ones in your graph through the `roam/js/iframely` page. You could configure individual ones by creating a child block of the iframele block that says `view` with the value as a child of that block. The valid values include:

- `summary` - Wraps rich media into a compact summary layout.
- `card` - Wraps rich media into a summary card. Works for players, images and some apps.
- `iframe` - Explicitly activates Iframely's async iFrames. Embed will be wrapped into Iframely iFrame and include required display helper.
- `off` - Disables any required or configured Iframely HTML helpers powered by Iframely's iFrames.
