Installing the Serendipity extension will create a `[[roam/js/serendipity]]` page if one does not exist already. On that page, you could configure various Serendipity related features.

#### Daily

The Daily feature will add random block references from your graph on to your daily notes page each day each timeyou log in to Roam. It supports the following settings:

- `includes` - The set of tags used to mark block references to pull randomly from. All blocks marked with one of these tags, or is a child of a block marked with one of these tags will be included. Can specify more than one. Default is empty. If one of the nested blocks is `{all}`, then all block uids from the graph will be included. 

- `excludes` - The set of tags used to mark block references to exclude from the set to pull randomly from. All blocks marked with one of these tags, or is a child of a block marked with one of these tags will be excluded. Can specify more than one.

- `label` - The label that gets added to your daily note page that's used to nest the randomly chosen block reference. Default value is `[[roam/js/serendipity]]`.

- `timeout` - The number of days that must pass before a block reference can be included in the randomness pool. Default value is 0.

- `count` - The number of block references to randomly pull from. Default value is 3.
